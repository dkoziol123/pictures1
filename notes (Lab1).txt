The Application Space is the container for your application and provides a canvas for Vue to work in. ==
<div id='app'>
  {{ message }}
</div>

The Vue Application is between the <script></script> of the HTML page. This is where most of the data is referenced and where the logic resides. 
<script>
  const app = new Vue {{
  el: '#app',

The common parts of a vue component are:  
1. Template - This is the container for the HTMLand some Vue Directives.
2. Script - this is where we put the logic for our application.
3. Style - no different than any standard web application - this is where the CSS is placed.


When you created this project, NPM created a couple of Vue components for us. One is /src/App.vue.  It is the root component for the project. Open this and you will find a common theme for most of the Vue Components as we have seen earlier. 

  data:{
   message: 'Hello World!!',
  }

});

</script>

el tell which element of our HTML we want Vue to manipulate

The “data” field receives a javascript object the data that will be manipulated in the context of our application.

Directives are the part of Vue.js that attach special meaning and behavior to plain html elements on the page.  They include:
v-html,
v-bind,
v-if, v-else , v-else-if,
v-for,
v-model
v-show
v-text


The v-html directive allows you to output content without using the mustache-style curly bracket syntax. It can also be used if the output includes HTML Tags.
You should only use v-html you trust since it could be a security risk!
